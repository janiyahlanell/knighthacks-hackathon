We have decided to do an all-in-one productivity application for our prototype.
we anticipate it will give us a ood foundation of code to use during the challenges of
the Hackathon.



++ Anticipated Tech Stack ++
Frontend

React + TailwindCSS → clean, fast UI.

TensorFlow.js / MediaPipe → in-browser detection (eye tracking, phone-in-hand, posture).

Backend

Node.js + Express (or FastAPI in Python) → handles API calls, user data, break recs.

Supabase / Firebase → quick auth, database, and hosting if you want less setup.

AI/ML

Computer Vision: TensorFlow.js or PyTorch (if server-based) for “phone detection.”

Recommendation AI: Use OpenAI API or Hugging Face to curate break content or suggest playlists based on mood/history.

APIs

Spotify API → mood playlists & lofi toggle.

YouTube API → break videos.

OpenAI API → optional AI coach/recommender.

Hosting

Frontend: Vercel / Netlify.

Backend: Railway / Render / Fly.io.
