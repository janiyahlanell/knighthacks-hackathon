   mood based / media based playlist provider 

- playlist reviewer 

- horror game 

- Productivity Pomodoro

- study app that detects if youre
on your phone and starts like blaring or something 
(could be implemented into the productivity app
idea) 
   - blast innapropriate noises if you look at your phone
   - autogenerate media during pomodoro break 
- study app that provides different ways to study your topics 
- reward system for a certainamount of streaks of pomodor cycles you do without the alarm balring


- a blog (anime, games, cutesy, etc)

We have decided to do an all-in-one productivity application for our prototype.
we anticipate it will give us a good foundation of code to use during the challenges of
the Hackathon.

++ Things To Know

   - our repository must be made after they say "Go"


++ Web Application Features ++

- Pomodoro feature 
   *rewadrd system for completing a certain amount of pomodoro cycles
   * Punishment for looking at your phone (maybe detecting it via bluetooth?) 
      alarm system?
   *Auto generate media during your break 

-  mood / media based study playlist (lofi inclusive)

- Quizzed study methods




++ Anticipated Tech Stack ++

Frontend

   React + TailwindCSS → clean, fast UI.

   TensorFlow.js / MediaPipe → in-browser detection (eye tracking, phone-in-hand, posture).

   Backend

   Node.js + Express (or FastAPI in Python) → handles API calls, user data, break recs.

   Supabase / Firebase → quick auth, database, and hosting if you want less setup.

AI/ML

   Computer Vision: TensorFlow.js or PyTorch (if server-based) for “phone detection.”

   Recommendation AI: Use OpenAI API or Hugging Face to curate break content or suggest playlists based on mood/history.

APIs

   Spotify API → mood playlists & lofi toggle.

   YouTube API → break videos.

   OpenAI API → optional AI coach/recommender.

Hosting

   Frontend: Vercel / Netlify.

   Backend: Railway / Render / Fly.io.
